# Kevin Gay - My Portfolio Site #
Hello and welcome to my portfolio website.  I enjoyed making this site the ***GitHub Pages***.  I could have done this many other ways, but I felt it was fitting to place it here.

I am constantly adding to the website to keep my most current work available, so by time you see this, it should be pretty current.  I am a full stack developer that enjoys working on projects from the Front-End.  

My goal in creating this, is to add value to an organization that takes pride in hiring high quality developers and investing in that developer's growth.  I'm also looking to use my skills in the best way possible for your organization, as well as commit myself to learning new technologies and best practices daily.

Enjoy the website and contact me if you are interested in moving forward with a conversation discussing future opportunities.
